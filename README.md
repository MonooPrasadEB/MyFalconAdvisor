# MyFalconAdvisor - Advanced AI Investment Platform

**Project Update**: Met with team today - Akshy is currently blocked on Cursor access and working on getting it resolved.

MyFalconAdvisor is a sophisticated multi-agent AI investment platform that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with quantitative finance to deliver personalized investment advice at scale. Built with Python, LangGraph, and real financial data integration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

MyFalconAdvisor revolutionizes traditional robo-advisors by introducing **conversation-driven financial guidance**. Unlike static dashboards that quietly adjust portfolios in the background, our platform engages users in natural dialogue to deliver personalized insights, compliance-checked recommendations, and transparent execution support.

### Problem Statement
Traditional robo-advisors lack interactivity and dynamic personalization, leaving users detached from their financial journey. Early-career investors and underserved individuals need guidance that is contextual, transparent, and interactive—not just automated rebalancing.

### Solution Approach
This system implements a **3-agent architecture** powered by LangGraph orchestration, replacing static recommendations with dynamic, conversational financial guidance that democratizes access to high-quality investment advice.

### Core Agents

1. **🧠 Multi-Task Agent**: Portfolio analysis, risk evaluation, and customer engagement
2. **⚡ Execution Agent**: Trade execution with regulatory compliance and user approval workflows
3. **✅ Compliance Reviewer**: SEC/FINRA/IRS policy validation and client communication optimization

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real Financial Data**: Integration with yfinance, Alpha Vantage, and FRED for live market data
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Modern portfolio theory, VaR calculations, and stress testing
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated SEC, FINRA, and IRS compliance checking
- **Risk Assessment**: Interactive risk profiling with scenario analysis
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: LangGraph-powered agent orchestration
- **Plain English Communication**: Complex financial concepts explained clearly

## 🛠 Technology Stack
